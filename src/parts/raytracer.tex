\section{Ray Tracer (Fall 2014)}

I built a C++ program that takes in a list of basic shapes and point lights
and generates a color image based on their 3D locations and assigned colors.
The program also uses the location and luminescence of point lights to
cast shadows and determine the intensity of the color on each rendered object.
