\section{EVE: Online Map (Fall 2013)}

I built 3D intractable viewer for a map from the game EVE: Online.
I used an SQL database the game developers released in order to generate
a graph of all the star systems and the connections between the star systems.
Using this graph, I implemented a path finding algorithm that finds the
shortest path between any two systems and displays it on the 3D map.
