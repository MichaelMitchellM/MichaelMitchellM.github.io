At Prizmiq I was given a project to build a server that takes in
a 3D model and a list of points that the model was viewed at.
With this data I used an AWS EC2 g2.2xlarge instance to calculate with
OpenGL how much each triangle in the model was viewed.
I then took this data and generated a heat map texture that when applied to the
original model shows how much each part of the model was looked at.
